   ___ Component function should be pure function does not have any side effect inside it directly 

___ Use effect hook runs after initial render and paint to the screen

___ Every effect returns a so-called cleanup function that function will be called before the component re-render or unmount

___ Setting state is Async not sync (immediately)

___ If you do not use children props in the Context API to pass the components the you have to memo all your components

___ You can use callback function inside the state value and it will run just one time on initial render.

___ When you pass any component to another component by Children if the parent re-rendered but the components you have passed by children nothing happened to it will not re-render again and that technique will save some performance.
 

___ use Effect runs after render happens that the reason will render any component twice. but with new routing we can fetch the data while the components render not after the rendering 

___ Do not create any function inside a react component if that function does not depend on any state or props.

___ Use useEffect for one side effect (one reason)
