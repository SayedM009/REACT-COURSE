__ Component function should be pure function does not have any side effect inside it directly 

__ use effect hook runs after initial render and paint to the screen

__ every effect returns a so-called cleanup function that function will be called before the component re-render or unmount

__ setting state is sync not Async (immedatilay)

__ If you do not use children props in the Context API to pass the components the you have to memo all your components

___ you can use callback function inside the state value and it will run just one time on initial render.

___ When you pass any component to another component by Children if the parent re-renderd but the components you have passed by children nothing happend to it it will not re-render again and that ticneec will save some performance
