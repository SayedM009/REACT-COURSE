React Fragments : allows us to have more than just one element inside a piece of JSX syntax
Ex: 
<> 
	<sapn></span>
	<p></p>
	<div></div>
</>

instead of any another container like (div, section)

Notes: When you rendering a list you can use key with React fragments in this way

<React.Fragments key="key name"> 
	
</React.Fragments>
