Techique of conntrolled elements basically consists of three steps :

1- define a piece of state 
2- Use that piece of state on the element that we want to control means (force the element to always take the value of this state varibale)
3- finally update the piece of state

EX :

1- const [test, setTest] = useState("")
2- <input value={test}></input>
3- <input value={test} onChange={(e)=> setTest(e.target.value)}></input>
